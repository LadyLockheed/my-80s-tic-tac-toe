# React + TypeScript + Vite

## About this project

To build a tic-tac-toe gives the opportunity to work with algorithms. I had a lot of help from internet and chatGPT with the logic for the game, I learned A LOT!

My other focus on this project was working with css, which is an area I have not had the opportunity to work with as much as I wanted in former projects. I built it NOT mobile first, because I did not plan to make it responsive at first. Though I felt this was also an area I needed to work with to remind myself of syntax and such, I implemented some responsiveness later in the project.

## TODO:s and things not included

- Naming: Review all variable and function names. Some could be renamed to make their purpose clearer.

- Style and design: There are a few bugs and other minor issues that need attention. For example, in mobile view, the user shouldn't have to scroll. Additionally, the squares in the corners of the board need a border-radius on only one corner to align with the board's overall border-radius.

- Tests: If this were a "real" project (e.g., for a company), tests would be a crucial part of the development process. However, I did not focus on tests at this stage, as my main goal was to practice logic, algorithms, and styling.

- Features: The game could include a history feature, allowing users to revert one or more steps in the game. It could also display a list of the most recent winners.

- Accessibility: Yes, it lacks correct semantic html and I have not checked if contrast and such is good enough.
